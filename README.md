total - Totani's intepolator of the Livermore model

These are [Tomononi Totani](http://tac.astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~totani/)'s 
Fortran codes to intepolate the supernova neutrino database described in 
his paper [Future Detection of Supernova Neutrino Burst and Explosion Mechanism]
(http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/496/i=1/a=216).

The codes are slightly modified so that they can be compiled with
[gfortran](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran).
A makefile is also provided to create a shared library,
which can be linked by C++ codes.
